As shown above, upon opening our app, the user will be prompted to enter specific information regarding their loan including the loan period, interest rate, loan amount, as well as their initial down payment.

Once the user taps the **_Calculate_** button, they will be sent to the next screen that displays their calculated amortization schedule based on the numbers that they inputted on the first screen.
